This is just a quick little script I pieced together to help evaluate the solutions of some Ruby excercises I saw come across the Fort Worth Ruby Brigade group mail.

Basically, just run:

<code>
  ruby compare.rb one/solutions.rb
</code>

This will give you one benchmark, some results on the console and a results file in /one.

If you'd really like to give the solutions a whirl try:

<code>
  ruby compare.rb -n 1000 one/solutions.rb
</code>

This will perform 1000 benchmarks on the various solutions. (The order in which each solution is executed is randomized for each benchmark.)

If you've got ideas on how to make this do more, just holler. mark mcspadden at gmail
